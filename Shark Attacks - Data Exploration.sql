/* In the second part of my project, I will extract several key insights that will be crucial for my final analysis. 
    Made by : Grama Alex È˜tefan

	This is my exploratory data phase, where I will dive in the cleaned dataset to help me get the accuracy of my conclusions
	and make more of a refined analysis in the end.

1.Shark Attacks Over Time

2.Countries with Most Shark Attacks (top dangerous )

3.Most Injured Body Parts

4.Shark Attacks by Time of Day

5. Most Common Shark Species in Attacks

6. Fatal vs. Non-Fatal by Species
   
7. Fatal and Non-Fatal by Age

8. Sex Categories and Fatalities

/* As an enclosure this is the end of my SQL project of cleaning and exploring data.
	Everything was tested before applying my concepts with a SELECT statement
    and if you spot too many unecesary SELECT statements they are to of course
	show the begining on visualising and thought processing of the data itself.
